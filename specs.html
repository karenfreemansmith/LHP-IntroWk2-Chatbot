  <h1>Chatbot AI</h1>
  <p>This is a single page application that allows the user to talk to the webpage.</p>
  <h2>Specs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The AI portion of Chatbot will evolve to include more advanced conversational skills:
      <ul>
        <li>General greetings: hello/goodbye, how are you?, what's your name, etc.</li>
        <li>Hobbies and Interests: have some she likes and others she doesn't.</li>
        <li>Give her some common sense "wisdom" by having her repeat favorite quotes to questions.</li>
        <li>Give her some religious opinions.</li>
        <li>Give her some political opinions.</li>
        <li>Give her a short history/bio - name, location, age, ethnicity, family, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Chatbot's skills should evolve and adapt over time to the people she talks to:
      <ul>
        <li>Chatbot's facts come with a degree of certainty</li>
        <li>"God" (the programmer) can give her 1000 certainty of her facts</li>
        <li>Trusted people can give her a new fact of 100 certainty</li>
        <li>Untrusted people can give her a new fact of 1 certainty</li>
        <li>When people disagree with Chatbot it can introduce doubt. (certainty-1/certainty-100)</li>
        <li>When people agree with Chatbot it can increase certainty. (certainty+1/certainty+100)</li>
        <li>People earn trust by having things in common with Chatbot and lose it by disagreement.</li>
        <li>People start at about 10 trust and can increase up to a max of 100 or a min of -100. This number of trust is how much certainty is added/subtracted to facts.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>I may want to give Chatbot a few distinct personalities (different gender/cultural backgrounds/areas of knowledge):
      <ul>
        <li>The personalities can express themselves with preferred "speech ticks" - what greeting they use most, or what slang phrases/quotes they prefer</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>I want a cute cartoon-like UI, lips, robots, hotpink on light-gray... </li>
    <li>Most of the page should be for the conversation, and it needs to be easy to read.</li>
    <li>Speech bubbles would be nice, should resemble IM/chat on a mobile device</li>
  </ul>
